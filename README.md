# Decentralized School Transportation Management

A blockchain-based solution for managing school transportation systems with enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency.

## Overview

The Decentralized School Transportation Management system leverages blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and efficient framework for managing school transportation operations. The system consists of four core smart contracts that work together to optimize routes, verify drivers, track student ridership, and schedule vehicle maintenance.

## Core Components

### Route Optimization Contract
Manages and optimizes bus routes based on student locations, traffic patterns, and time constraints to ensure efficient transportation.

- Automatically calculates optimal routes using geospatial data
- Adapts to changing conditions such as road closures or weather events
- Provides real-time updates to drivers and administrators
- Stores historical route data for analysis and improvement

### Driver Verification Contract
Ensures all drivers meet required qualifications and maintains comprehensive safety records.

- Securely stores driver credentials and certifications
- Tracks license validity and expiration dates
- Records safety incidents and driving history
- Implements a reputation system based on driving performance
- Provides immutable audit trail for compliance requirements

### Ridership Tracking Contract
Monitors student pickup and drop-off to ensure all students are accounted for throughout their journey.

- Records student boarding and exiting events
- Notifies parents and administrators of arrivals and departures
- Maintains attendance records for reporting and analysis
- Supports RFID/NFC integration for automated tracking
- Implements privacy controls to protect student information

### Maintenance Scheduling Contract
Manages vehicle maintenance schedules based on usage metrics and manufacturer recommendations.

- Tracks vehicle mileage, engine hours, and operating conditions
- Schedules routine maintenance based on usage thresholds
- Records maintenance history and parts replacement
- Alerts administrators to upcoming maintenance requirements
- Analyzes maintenance costs and vehicle performance

## Technical Architecture

The system is built on a blockchain infrastructure that ensures data integrity, transparency, and security. Smart contracts execute automatically when predefined conditions are met, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring consistent application of rules.

### Key Features

- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure or control
- **Immutability**: Tamper-proof record of all transportation operations
- **Transparency**: Stakeholders can verify system operations
- **Automation**: Smart contracts execute without human intervention
- **Security**: Cryptographic protection of sensitive information

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Safety**: Improved driver verification and maintenance tracking
- **Increased Efficiency**: Optimized routes reduce fuel consumption and travel time
- **Better Accountability**: Clear audit trails for all transportation activities
- **Reduced Administrative Burden**: Automated processes minimize paperwork
- **Improved Communication**: Real-time updates to all stakeholders
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Comprehensive analytics for continuous improvement

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain environment
- Web3 provider
- NodeJS v14.0 or higher
- Truffle Suite (for development and testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/decentralized-school-transport.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd decentralized-school-transport
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your blockchain provider details
   ```

4. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

5. Deploy to your preferred network:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network [network_name]
   ```

### Configuration

Each contract requires specific configuration parameters:

- **Route Optimization**: Geographic boundaries, school locations, time constraints
- **Driver Verification**: Required certification types, minimum qualifications
- **Ridership Tracking**: Student roster, privacy settings, notification preferences
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Vehicle specifications, maintenance intervals

## Usage Examples

### Administrator Dashboard

```javascript
// Connect to the Route Optimization contract
const routeContract = await RouteOptimization.deployed();

// Generate optimal routes for tomorrow
const routes = await routeContract.generateRoutes(tomorrow, weatherForecast);

// Check driver eligibility
const driverContract = await DriverVerification.deployed();
const isEligible = await driverContract.checkDriverStatus(driverId);
```

### Driver Application

```javascript
// Connect to the Route contract
const routeContract = await RouteOptimization.deployed();

// Get assigned route
const myRoute = await routeContract.getDriverRoute(driverId);

// Update current position
await routeContract.updatePosition(driverId, currentLatitude, currentLongitude);
```

### Parent Portal

```javascript
// Connect to the Ridership contract
const ridershipContract = await RidershipTracking.deployed();

// Subscribe to pickup/dropoff events for a student
ridershipContract.StudentEvent({ studentId: myChildId })
  .on('data', (event) => {
    console.log(`Student ${event.studentId} ${event.eventType} at ${event.timestamp}`);
  });
```

## Security Considerations

- Access control mechanisms restrict sensitive operations
- Data privacy features protect student and driver personal information
- Regular security audits recommended for all deployed contracts
- Multi-signature requirements for critical administrative functions
